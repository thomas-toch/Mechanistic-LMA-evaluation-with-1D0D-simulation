"Note (C. Yuhn, as of 20190704):",,,,,,,,,,
Total resisntances were modified based on Liang (2009b) for 1-55 and Liang (2011) for 56-83.,,,,,,,,,,
"Radius of the anterior communicating artery was corrected (Alastruey, 2007).",,,,,,,,,,
Geometries and resistance 1 of the splenic and gastric arteries were transposed (splenic artery is larger).,,,,,,,,,,
Geometries of the posterior and anterior tibal arteries were corrected.,,,,,,,,,,
Non-zero values of resistance 1 were set only for the terminal arteries.,,,,,,,,,,
Definition of Rctree was modified and now they will be directly used for the simulation.,,,,,,,,,,
"Note (Y. Kotani, as of 20250820):",,,,,,,,,,
"Artery no. 84-90 were added for lumped LMA models. For detailed LMA model, these parameters will not be referenced.",,,,,,,,,,
